# Portfolio
Portfolio meant for me to showcase and share my journey in programming, network and server exploration. With a bit of my voluntary work added.

Welcome to my github, first of all i would just like to say thank you for visiting my portfolio repository.
At the current stage in life, im a it-support student at Aalborg Techcollege, so therefor my portfolio will showcase some of my development journey.
